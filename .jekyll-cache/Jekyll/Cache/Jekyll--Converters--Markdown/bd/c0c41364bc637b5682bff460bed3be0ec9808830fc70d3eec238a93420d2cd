<h2 id="vim-and-terminal">Vim and Terminal!?</h2>
<p>Vim was made to work with the command line. Many beginners do not understand what are the true capabilities of Vim, myself included:) Vim can run terminal commands without leaving the text editor, open an instance of a terminal, work with shell environments, and other things depending on the use case.</p>
