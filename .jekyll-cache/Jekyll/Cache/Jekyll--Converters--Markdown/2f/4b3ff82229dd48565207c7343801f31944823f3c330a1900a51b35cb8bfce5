<p>If you are new to BASH and Linux, donâ€™t you worry the community is the driving force here. If someoneâ€™s stuck somewhere, the platforms, forums, and blogs are ready to help anyone there. BASH is a short term of Bourne-Again Shell, it is a shell interface that has much more capabilities and functions than the simple Bourne shell(sh). It has some quite remarkable features and it is even capable of calling itself a programming language in some sense.</p>

<p>Without wasting any time on the introduction, letâ€™s keep the article rolling.
In this part, Iâ€™ll try to cover the basics of the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Structure of Bash Script.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Variables.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>If-else Conditional Statements.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Loops.</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>For loop</li>
      <li>While loop</li>
      <li>Until loop</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Functions.</strong></li>
</ul>
