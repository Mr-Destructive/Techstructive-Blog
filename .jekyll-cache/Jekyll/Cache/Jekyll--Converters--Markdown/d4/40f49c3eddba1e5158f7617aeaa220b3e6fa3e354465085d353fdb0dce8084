I"r<p>We all are asked to use visual studio code and other rich looking editors as a beginners text editor or an IDE but that makes a habit of a rich and pleasing interface of running and debugging programs, and that is the reason we donâ€™t feel good to use command line or the terminal. Terminal or Command line are quite important to learn and are powerful as well.</p>
